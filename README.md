# LSB Image Steganography

### **Overview**
Welcome to the world of secure communication and image processing! This project demonstrates how to conceal and extract messages in images using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique. By embedding data at the binary level of image pixels, messages remain undetectable to the naked eye. A unique key or secret ensures that only authorized users can decode the hidden data.

### **Features**
- Implement secure data hiding and extraction using the LSB mechanism.
- Utilize individual keys/secrets for message decryption.
- Learn fundamental image processing techniques.
- Hands-on exploration of function pointers, file I/O, and bitwise operations.

### **How It Works**
1. **Data Embedding**: Replace the least significant bits of image data with the message bits.
2. **Data Extraction**: Use the key/secret to retrieve and decode the original message.
3. **Image Processing Fundamentals**: Manipulate and analyze images at the binary level.

### **Prerequisites**
Before diving into this project, ensure you are familiar with:
- **Function Pointers**: Enhance modularity and flexibility in coding.
- **File I/O Operations**: Read/write files effectively for image handling.
- **Bitwise Operations**: Master binary-level data manipulation.

### **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LSB-Image-Steganography.git
   cd LSB-Image-Steganography
